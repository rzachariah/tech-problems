## minSum
Given a list of integers, perform some number k of operations. Each operation consists of removing any element from the array,
dividing it by 2 and inserting the ceiling of that result back into the array. 
Minimize the sum of elements in the final array.

## findSmallestDivisor
Given two strings, s and t, determine if s is divisible by t (ie s can be formed by repetition of t).
If not, return -1.
If so, return the length of the smallest string that is a divisor of both s and t.
